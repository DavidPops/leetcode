Result table:

| customer_id | count_no_trans |

+-------------+----------------+
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the 
visit with id = 12. Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one 
transaction during the visit with id = 13. Customer with id = 30 visited the 
mall once and did not make any transactions. Customer with id = 54 visited the 
mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during 
one visit they made 3 transactions. Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once 
and did not make any transactions. As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 
visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also user 54 visited 
the mall twice and did not make any transactions.*/

SQL Schema
Table: Users
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| account      | int     |
| name         | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
account is the primary key for this table. Each row of this table contains the 
account number of each user in the bank. 

Table: Transactions
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| trans_id      | int     |
| account       | int     |
| amount        | int     |
| transacted_on | date    |
+---------------+---------+
trans_id is the primary key for this table. Each row of this table contains all 
changes made to all accounts. amount is positive if the user received money and 
negative if they transferred money. All accounts start with a balance 0. Write 
an SQL query to report the name and balance of users with a balance higher than 
10000. The balance of an account is equal to the sum of the amounts of all 
transactions involving that account. Return the result table in any order. 

The query result format is in the following example.

Users table:
+------------+--------------+
| account    | name         |
+------------+--------------+
| 900001     | Alice        |
| 900002     | Bob          |

Alice's balance is (7000 + 7000 - 3000) = 11000.
Bob's balance is 1000.
